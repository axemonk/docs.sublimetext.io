It is supported on macOS, Windows and Linux. Its versatility comes from a wide range of community-developed third-party packages that provide syntax highlighting, snippets, or other automation backed by <a href="https://python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Python</a> plugins. The default distribution of Sublime Text aims to provide a basic but very functional set of features, but it can easily be turned into a full-fledged IDE, if so desired.</p><p>In this guide, you will learn how to use Sublime Text effectively and how to extend it with functionality that caters to your workflow.</p><p>If you&#39;re starting out with Sublime Text and already installed it, we recommend beginning with the <a href="./getting-started/basic-concepts.html">Basic Concepts</a> page. Otherwise, feel free to use the sidebar on the left to navigate to your topic of interest.</p><p>If you&#39;re interested in the nitty-gritty details of how you can customize and extend Sublime Text to your liking, check out the <a href="/reference/">Reference</a> section of this guide via the navigation bar on top. You can always go back to this page by clicking on &quot;Guide&quot; in that same bar.</p><p><strong>Happy learning!</strong></p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">One last note before you dive in</p><p>You can switch the page&#39;s theme by using the cog in the top navigation bar. Changing the theme and using the search bar require JavaScript, because this is a statically hosted site.

In 2014, it was backed by a fundraiser and supported by individuals and Sublime HQ Pty Ltd.</p><p>After that version of the docs, originally hosted on <a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://docs.sublimetext.info/</a>, went down in November 2019 and the maintainer of both the repo and the domain could not be contacted anymore, the project was forked of the original under an older, more permissive license and rebooted at its current domain of <a href="https://docs.sublimetext.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.sublimetext.io/</a>. In the process, the underlying markup rendering framework was changed from <a href="https://sphinx-doc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sphinx</a> to <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vuepress</a> and now to <a href="https://vitepress.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vitepress</a> and the documents have been restructured into the two guide and reference main sections you can see in the navigation bar at the top.</p><h2 id="contributing-to-the-documentation" tabindex="-1">Contributing to the Documentation <a class="header-anchor" href="#contributing-to-the-documentation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Contributing to the Documentation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you want to contribute to this documentation, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/sublimetext-io/docs.sublimetext.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.
